CSS-Navbar 0.3
==============

Description
------------------------

CSS-Navbar is a versatile, easy-to-use navigation bar with optional drop-down menus. It is written in [LESS](http://lesscss.org/) and compiled to CSS. Unlike other menu systems, CSS-Navbar does not depend on Javascript for exanding and animating menus. With CSS-Navbar, your navigation will work in all major browsers (including IE 7+), even if Javascript is disabled!

Features
------------------------

- Mobile-friendly, using CSS3 media queries
- Subtle CSS3 transitions for opening and closing menus
- Easy theme creation -- a LESS theme template makes customizing easy
